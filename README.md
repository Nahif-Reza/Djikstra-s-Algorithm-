Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation
This repository contains a C++ implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm. 
Dijkstra's Algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

Implementation Details:

1. The graph is represented using an adjacency list.
2. Priority queue (Min Heap) is used to efficiently find the node with the shortest distance.
3. The program prompts the user to input the number of vertices/nodes, number of edges, and the root node.
4. Users then input the edges of the graph along with their weights.
5. Finally, the algorithm calculates and prints the shortest distance from the root node to all other nodes in the graph.
